# Shawn_Portfolio

## [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) via Matrix Decomposition](https://github.com/longxiangdai/Shawn-Portfolio/blob/main/PCA%20via%20Matrix%20Decomposition/Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20(PCA)%20via%20Matrix%20Decomposition.ipynb)
- Provided the mathematical background of Principal Component Analysis
- Showed how the principal components can be obtained via Singular Value Decomposition of the centered data matrix
- Gave an example and exhibited how the technique can be useful for dimensionality reduction and outlier detection

## [Deep Learning - Education Framework]
- Implemented the educational framework (EDF), a deep learning framework, using Python-NumPy
- Constructed the computation graph of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer
- Explored how the learning rate and number of layers affect the performance of the neural network

## [Robot Localization (Hidden Markov Models)]
- Developed a hidden Markov model to estimate the trajectory of a wheeled robot that moves over rooms
- Used the Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate the transition, observation, and prior probabilities from observations
- Implemented the Viterbi algorithm to identify the most likely sequence of robot locations based upon the corresponding of observations

## [Robot Localization (Extended Kalman Filter)]
- Developed a vacuum cleaning robot and estimate its position and orientation in a room in order to be more efficient and precise at vacuuming
- Implemented an EKF to estimate the robot's trajectory based upon the control (forward distance and change in orientation) and measurement data from a sensor placed on the floor of the room that the robot is vacuuming
- Visualized the robot's estimated and ground-truth trajectories

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/longxiangdai/Shawn-Portfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/longxiangdai/Shawn-Portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
