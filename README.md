## [Robot Localization: Hidden Markov Models (HMM)]
- Developed a hidden Markov model to estimate the trajectory of a wheeled robot that moves over rooms
- Used the Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate the transition, observation, and prior probabilities from observations
- Implemented the Viterbi algorithm to identify the most likely sequence of robot locations based upon the corresponding of observations

## [Robot Localization: Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)]
- Developed a vacuum cleaning robot and estimate its position and orientation in a room in order to be more efficient and precise at vacuuming
- Implemented an EKF to estimate the robot's trajectory based upon the control (forward distance and change in orientation) and measurement data from a sensor placed on the floor of the room that the robot is vacuuming
- Visualized the robot's estimated (#red) and ground-truth (#green) trajectories

## [Robot Localization: EKF + Particle Filter]
- Improved the EKF and better estimate the pose of the vacuum cleaner by replacing the seneor placed on the ceiling with a LIDAR sensor that records the range and bearing as the robot navigates
- Implemented a standard particle filter that samples from the motion model, reweights the particles according to the observation likelihood, and resamples new particles according to their weights
- Tested the robot in three different environments (simple world, loops world, and rooms world) and showed that the model performs well without knowing the robot's initial pose

## [Robot Localization: EKF + Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (SLAM)]
- Implemented the SLAM algorithm that constructs and updates a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of the robot's location within it
- Added landmarks to the map and used the sensor (a LIDAR with maximum range of 4 m and an angular field-of-view of 180 degrees) to update the trajectories of the robot and the locations of the landmarks
- Visualized the position of the robot and map estimates along with uncertainty ellipses

## [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) via Matrix Decomposition](https://github.com/longxiangdai/Shawn-Portfolio/blob/main/PCA%20via%20Matrix%20Decomposition/Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20(PCA)%20via%20Matrix%20Decomposition.ipynb)
- Provided the mathematical background of Principal Component Analysis
- Showed how the principal components can be obtained via Singular Value Decomposition of the centered data matrix
- Gave an example and exhibited how the technique can be useful for dimensionality reduction and outlier detection

## [Deep Learning - Education Framework]
- Implemented the educational framework (EDF), a deep learning framework, using Python-NumPy
- Constructed the computation graph of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer
- Explored how the learning rate and number of layers affect the performance of the neural network
